# Text Classification

A study of the performance of various models for text classification

### Dataset
###### [20 Newsgroups](https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/20-newsgroups) dataset that contains news articles on various topics like sports, business, etc.

The repo contains 4 files:
- one for the various classical methods like Naive Bayes, linear regression and SVM. 
- one for the Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) model 
- one for the Recurrent Neural Network(GRU) model
- one for the Hierarchical Attention Network(HAN) model 

##### The CNN and HAN models work very well for such classification tasks
